Riak is a Dynamo-inspired key/value store with a distributed database
network platform that makes storing and retrieving data simple, safe
and low-cost. Riak liberates data from vulnerable centralized databases,
allowing it to escape catastrophic losses and surges while accelerating
the speed of applications. Riak has no single point of failure. Its
multiple nodes create a truly fault-tolerant system for storing any
type of mission-critical data.
