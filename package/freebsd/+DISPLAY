Thank you for installing Riak.

Riak has been installed in /usr/local/riak owned by user:group riak:riak

The primary directories are:

    {platform_bin_dir, "/usr/local/riak/bin"}
    {platform_data_dir, "/usr/local/riak/data"}
    {platform_etc_dir, "/usr/local/riak/etc"}
    {platform_lib_dir, "/usr/local/riak/lib"}
    {platform_log_dir, "/usr/local/riak/log"}

These can be configured and changed in the platform_etc_dir/app.config.

Add /usr/local/riak/bin to your path to run the riak, riak-admin, and search-cmd 
scripts directly.
