Riak client libraries are available for many languages.  Rather than bundle them with the Riak server source code, we have given them each their own source repository.  Currently, official Riak client language libraries include:

   + Javascript

   + Python
     http://github.com/basho/riak-python-client

   + Ruby
     http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/

   + Java

   + PHP
     http://github.com/basho/riak-php-client

   + Erlang

In addition to the officially supported client libraries, a complete list of community-contributed client libraries and related code can be found on the Riak Wiki:
