Riak client libraries are available for many languages.  Rather than
bundle them with the Riak server source code, we have given them each
their own source repository.  Currently, official Riak client language
libraries include:

   + Javascript
     https://github.com/basho/riak-javascript-client

   + Python
     https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client

   + Ruby
     http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/

   + Java
     https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client

   + PHP
     https://github.com/basho/riak-php-client

   + Erlang
     https://github.com/basho/riak-erlang-client
     (using protocol buffers instead of distributed Erlang)
