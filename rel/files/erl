## This script replaces the default "erl" in erts-VSN/bin. This is necessary
## as escript depends on erl and in turn, erl depends on having access to a
## bootscript (start.boot). Note that this script is ONLY invoked as a side-effect
## of running escript -- the embedded node bypasses erl and uses erlexec directly
## (as it should). 
##
## Note that this script makes the assumption that there is a start_clean.boot
## file available in $ROOTDIR/release/VSN.

# Determine the abspath of where this script is executing from.

# Now determine the root directory -- this script runs from erts-VSN/bin,
# so we simply need to strip off two dirs from the end of the ERTS_BIN_DIR
# path.
