erlang_js has only been tested on Unix-based platforms (Linux, OS X, and Solaris). Please do not try
to compile and/or use erlang_js on Windows. It will not work.

We've tried to keep the compile process simple and fast. You will need the CVS command-line client
installed in order for the compile to work. To compile erlang_js issue the command 'make' in a
terminal. The build will download and build nspr and SpiderMonkey. It will also build the
linked-in driver, spidermonkey_drv, and the Erlang source.

You can test the freshly build code via 'make test' which should report all tests passed if the
build was successful.
