# +B [c | d | i]
# Option c makes Ctrl-C interrupt the current shell instead of invoking the emulator break
# handler. Option d (same as specifying +B without an extra option) disables the break handler. # Option i makes the emulator ignore any break signal.
# If option c is used with oldshell on Unix, Ctrl-C will restart the shell process rather than
# interrupt it.
# Disable the emulator break handler
# it easy to accidentally type ctrl-c when trying
# to reach for ctrl-d. ctrl-c on a live node can
# have very undesirable results
